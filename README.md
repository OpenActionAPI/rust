# openaction-rs

A Rust crate for creating plugins for the [OpenAction API](https://openaction.amansprojects.com) (compatible with the Stream Deck SDK).

My [Element Call plugin](https://github.com/ninjadev64/openaction-element-call) serves as a minimal example of using this crate.
The [OpenDeck Starter Pack plugin](https://github.com/ninjadev64/opendeck-starterpack) is also made with this crate.
