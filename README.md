# openaction-rs

A Rust crate for creating plugins for the [OpenAction API](https://openaction.amankhanna.me) (compatible with the Stream Deck SDK).

My [Linux Media plugin](https://github.com/nekename/oampris) serves as a minimal example of using this crate.
The [OpenDeck Starter Pack plugin](https://github.com/nekename/OpenDeck/tree/main/plugins/com.amansprojects.starterpack.sdPlugin) is also made with this crate.
